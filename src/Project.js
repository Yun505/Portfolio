                    <Card.Title>AP Microeconomics Dating Simulation</Card.Title>
                    <Card.Text>
                        <p>This was created for a unit review presentation in microeconomics to engage my classmates at the end of the lesson. During the presentation I reviewed why the question was wrong before moving on to the next one. The pictures are of BCA that I took and edited. There are 6 endings with the higher the ending number, the happier the ending. Penalty points do not correspond with ending numbers. The less penalty points you have, the better.
                        </p>
                        <p>Goal: to get as many correct answers to win the heart of the textbook character like any other dating simulation
                        </p>
                        <p>Wrong Answer: Takes player to  fitness center, the "dungeon" as BCA students call it + penalty point.

                    <Card.Text>
                        <p>One day, I was eating Natto and struggling to get some of the sticky strings out of my hair when I came up with this idea. The layout is that of the bowl where the player is a rice grain trying to navigate through the bowl without hitting the obstacles. Each obstacle slows down the player when hit but by different speeds. The player becomes red when they hit an obstacle.
                            There are two levels in this game and the second level has more obstacles + is faster.
                        </p>
                        <p>Three obstacles: Sticky Natto, Natto, Sticky Strings</p>

                        <p>Player can choose 3 modes: AI, 2 player, 4 player to play the game. The game was designed with the idea in mind that players could play in the same room on one computer without knowing the other playerâ€™s cards.
                            Cards are randomly imported into the hands of the players. The player has the option to hit or pass each turn. If a player goes over 21 or chooses to keep their hand, the next player now has the same choice.
                            If the last player goes over 21 or chooses to keep their hand, the game will go to a screen, which will show who wins and add a counter for who won.
